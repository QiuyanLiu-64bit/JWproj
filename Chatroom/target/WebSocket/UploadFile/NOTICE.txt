When you build your project through Maven (such as executing an mvn package),
Maven will package the files under src/main/webapp into a WAR file based on the configuration in the pom.xml file.
This WAR file is an archive file for web applications and can be directly recognized and deployed by Tomcat.

If you create a new folder in the webapp and the folder is not copied to the final WAR file, it may be because:
The build configuration ignored this folder:
The build tool may be configured to ignore certain directories or files.

So we should create a file to occupy the space in the folder,
and then the folder will be copied to the final WAR file.
